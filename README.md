The code scrapes the oem site for cisco and gives the vulnerabilities of it
Used the explicit wait block the one in try and except to wait for the vulnerabilities to get updated from the database
it gives a lot of space between each vulnerability
fixing things - we need to clean the data a bit more 
                get more urls form different sites so that it can be scraped 
                scrape a url multiple times in a day
